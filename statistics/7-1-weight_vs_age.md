[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> * Pearson's Correlation: 0.07
>> * Spearman's Correlation: 0.09

>> The code can be found in [here] (https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/chap07soln.py). There is a weak relationship between birth weight vs. mother's age. The following conclusions are from the previous link where we can find the code:

>> *1) The scatterplot shows a weak relationship between the variables.*
 
>> *2) The correlations support this.  Pearson's is around 0.07, Spearman's
is around 0.09.  The difference between them suggests some influence
of outliers or a non-linear relationsip.*

>> *3) Plotting percentiles of weight versus age suggests that the
relationship is non-linear.  Birth weight increases more quickly
in the range of mother's age from 15 to 25.  After that, the effect
is weaker.*
