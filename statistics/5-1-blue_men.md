[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> The following [link] (https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/chap05soln.ipynb) shows the code and details. In order to find what percentage of the male population in US is in between 5'10" and 6'1", we look at the *cumulative distribution functions* (CDF) and get the difference to find the value in between:

>> 5'10" = 177.8 cm

>> 6'1" = 185.4 cm

>> CDF(177.8) = 0.49

>> CDF(185.4) = 0.83

>> * 48% of the male population is more than 5'10"
>> * 83% of the male population is more than 6'1"

>> So the male population in US in between 5'10" and 6'1" is **34%**
