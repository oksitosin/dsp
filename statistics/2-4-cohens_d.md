[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> * Cohen’s d for weight: -0.089 ---> effect size is always absolute value: **0.089**
>> * Cohen’s d for preg_length: **0.029**

>> Both are considered very small effects. 
   
   >> * *small effect 0 to 0.20*
   >> * *medium effect 0.20 to 0.50*
   >> * *large effect more than 0.50*
  
>> We can say that the weight mean of the first babies (control group) are slightly less than the others (experimental group).
>> On the other hand the mean of the pregnancy length of first babies is slightly more than others.
